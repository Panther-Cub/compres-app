# Simplified Update System

## Overview

The update system has been simplified to provide a more reliable and user-friendly experience. The previous complex configuration system has been replaced with a streamlined approach that works consistently in both development and production environments.

## What Changed

### Before (Complex System)
- Multiple configuration options (auto-check intervals, channels, notifications, etc.)
- Complex settings management
- Issues with development mode updates
- Overly complicated UI with many toggles and options

### After (Simplified System)
- Automatic update checks on startup
- Manual update checks via UI
- Works in both development and production
- Clean, simple UI
- Reliable GitHub integration

## How It Works

### Development Mode
- Uses GitHub API to check for latest releases
- Bypasses electron-updater limitations
- Provides immediate feedback on update availability
- Shows current version vs latest version

### Production Mode
- Uses electron-updater for automatic updates
- Handles download and installation
- Provides progress tracking
- Fallback to manual download if needed

## Features

### Automatic Updates
- ✅ Checks for updates on app startup (5 second delay)
- ✅ Works in development and production
- ✅ GitHub releases integration
- ✅ User-friendly notifications

### Manual Updates
- ✅ Manual check button in settings
- ✅ Progress tracking for downloads
- ✅ Install and restart functionality
- ✅ Error handling with fallbacks

### User Experience
- ✅ Simple, clean interface
- ✅ Clear status indicators
- ✅ Progress bars for downloads
- ✅ Informative error messages

## Configuration

The update system uses these settings:

```typescript
// Development mode
forceDevUpdateConfig: true
autoDownload: false
autoInstallOnAppQuit: false
allowPrerelease: false

// GitHub integration
provider: 'github'
owner: 'Panther-Cub'
repo: 'compress-app'
```

## API Methods

### Available Methods
- `checkForUpdates()` - Check for available updates
- `downloadUpdate()` - Download the latest update
- `installUpdate()` - Install and restart the app
- `getUpdateStatus()` - Get current update status

### Event Listeners
- `onUpdateStatus` - Listen for status changes

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

1. **Network Issues** - Shows user-friendly error messages
2. **GitHub API Errors** - Graceful fallback with error details
3. **Installation Failures** - Opens GitHub releases page for manual download
4. **Development Mode** - Uses manual API checks instead of electron-updater

## Testing

To test the update system:

1. **Development Mode**: Run `npm run electron-dev` and check the console logs
2. **Production Mode**: Build the app and test update functionality
3. **Manual Test**: Use the "Check for Updates" button in settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Update checks are disabled in development mode"**
   - This is expected behavior in development
   - The system uses manual GitHub API checks instead

2. **"GitHub API returned 404"**
   - Check that the repository exists and is public
   - Verify the owner/repo names in constants

3. **"Update installation failed"**
   - The app will open GitHub releases page
   - Download and install manually

### Debug Information

The system logs detailed information to help with debugging:

```bash
# Check console logs for:
- Auto-updater configuration
- Update check attempts
- GitHub API responses
- Error details
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the update system:

1. **Delta Updates** - Only download changed files
2. **Background Updates** - Download updates in background
3. **Rollback Support** - Ability to revert to previous version
4. **Update Channels** - Support for beta/alpha releases
5. **Custom Update Servers** - Support for private update servers

## Migration Notes

If you were using the old update configuration system:

1. All complex settings have been removed
2. The UI has been simplified
3. Update behavior is now automatic and reliable
4. No migration of old settings is needed

The new system is designed to "just work" without requiring user configuration.
