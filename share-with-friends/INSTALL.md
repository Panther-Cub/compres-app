# Installation Instructions for FFmpeg Video Compressor

## Mac Installation

### If you get "App is damaged" error:

1. **Download the app** (FFmpeg Video Compressor.zip)
2. **Extract the ZIP file** by double-clicking it
3. **Don't double-click the app yet!**

### Bypass the security warning:

**Method 1 (Easiest):**
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on the app
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the warning dialog
4. The app will now run normally

**Method 2 (If Method 1 doesn't work):**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `xattr -cr ` (with a space at the end)
3. Drag the app into Terminal (this will add the path)
4. Press Enter
5. Now double-click the app to open it

**Method 3 (System Preferences):**
1. Go to System Preferences â†’ Security & Privacy
2. Click "Open Anyway" if you see a message about the blocked app

### Why this happens:
This app isn't signed with an expensive Apple Developer certificate ($99/year), but it's completely safe to use. macOS shows this warning for all unsigned apps as a security precaution.

### After first launch:
Once you've opened the app successfully once, macOS will remember it's safe and you can open it normally in the future.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:
1. Make sure you extracted the ZIP file completely
2. Try moving the app to your Applications folder
3. Restart your Mac and try again
