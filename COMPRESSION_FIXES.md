# Compression Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Excessive Debug Logging
**Problem**: The console was flooded with hundreds of "Total Progress Debug" messages every time progress was calculated.

**Solution**: 
- Added `lastProgressLogRef` to track the last logged progress value
- Only log progress changes when there's a meaningful difference (≥5%)
- Reduced console spam while maintaining useful progress information

### 2. File Naming Inconsistency
**Problem**: Some files were showing as full paths while others showed as just filenames, causing task key mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Standardized file naming using `getFileName(file)` consistently across all components
- Updated the `getTaskKey` function to use the same naming logic as the compression manager
- Ensured task keys match between the frontend hook and backend manager

### 3. 99% Progress Stuck Issue
**Problem**: FFmpeg would report progress up to 99% and then appear to hang while finalizing files.

**Solution**:
- Added progress smoothing logic to handle FFmpeg's progress reporting quirks
- Implemented timeout detection for when progress gets stuck at 99%
- Gradually increase progress to 99.5% when stuck for more than 5 seconds
- Send final 100% progress before completion events
- Applied fixes to all compression strategies (basic, single-pass, two-pass)

### 4. Missing Folder Organization
**Problem**: All compressed files were dumped into a single output directory without organization.

**Solution**:
- Created `createPresetFolder()` function to organize output by preset
- Updated `buildOutputPath()` to create preset-specific folders
- Files are now organized as: `outputDirectory/presetName/filename.ext`
- Cleaner file naming without preset suffixes in filenames

### 5. Content Security Policy Warning
**Problem**: Electron was showing security warnings about insecure CSP.

**Solution**:
- Added proper Content Security Policy to the main window
- Set secure web preferences with `webSecurity: true`
- Disabled `allowRunningInsecureContent`

### 6. Multiple File Compression Issues
**Problem**: Multiple files weren't being processed correctly with multiple presets.

**Solution**:
- Fixed task key generation to be consistent between frontend and backend
- Improved progress tracking for multiple concurrent compressions
- Better error handling for individual file failures
- Proper cleanup of compression tasks

## Technical Improvements

### Progress Tracking Enhancements
- Added progress smoothing to prevent UI jitter
- Implemented meaningful change detection (≥0.5% difference)
- Better handling of FFmpeg's progress reporting quirks
- Separate progress handling for two-pass encoding (50% per pass)

### Error Handling
- Improved error reporting for individual file failures
- Better cleanup of failed compression tasks
- More descriptive error messages

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced unnecessary progress updates
- Better memory management for active compression tracking
- Improved task cleanup

## File Structure Changes

### Output Organization
```
outputDirectory/
├── high-quality/
│   ├── video1.mp4
│   └── video2.mp4
├── medium-quality/
│   ├── video1.mp4
│   └── video2.mp4
└── low-quality/
    ├── video1.mp4
    └── video2.mp4
```

### Code Changes
- `src/hooks/useVideoCompression.ts` - Fixed progress tracking and task management
- `src/electron/compression/utils.ts` - Added folder organization
- `src/electron/compression/strategies/basic.ts` - Improved progress handling
- `src/electron/compression/strategies/single-pass.ts` - Enhanced progress tracking
- `src/electron/compression/strategies/two-pass.ts` - Better two-pass progress
- `src/main.ts` - Added Content Security Policy

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multiple File Test**: Select 3-4 videos and compress with 2-3 different presets
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Watch for smooth progress updates without console spam
3. **Folder Organization**: Verify files are organized by preset in output directory
4. **Error Handling**: Test with corrupted or unsupported video files
5. **Security**: Check that CSP warnings are gone in development mode

## Future Improvements

- Add compression queue management for better resource control
- Implement compression speed estimation
- Add support for batch processing with different settings per file
- Consider adding compression quality preview
- Implement compression history and resume functionality
