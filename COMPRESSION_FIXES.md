# Compression Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Excessive Debug Logging
**Problem**: The console was flooded with hundreds of "Total Progress Debug" messages every time progress was calculated.

**Solution**: 
- Added `lastProgressLogRef` to track the last logged progress value
- Only log progress changes when there's a meaningful difference (≥5%)
- Reduced console spam while maintaining useful progress information

### 2. File Naming Inconsistency
**Problem**: Some files were showing as full paths while others showed as just filenames, causing task key mismatches.

**Solution**:
- Standardized file naming using `getFileName(file)` consistently across all components
- Updated the `getTaskKey` function to use the same naming logic as the compression manager
- Ensured task keys match between the frontend hook and backend manager

### 3. 99% Progress Stuck Issue
**Problem**: FFmpeg would report progress up to 99% and then appear to hang while finalizing files.

**Solution**:
- Added progress smoothing logic to handle FFmpeg's progress reporting quirks
- Implemented timeout detection for when progress gets stuck at 99%
- Gradually increase progress to 99.5% when stuck for more than 5 seconds
- Send final 100% progress before completion events
- Applied fixes to all compression strategies (basic, single-pass, two-pass)

### 4. Missing Folder Organization
**Problem**: All compressed files were dumped into a single output directory without organization.

**Solution**:
- Created `createPresetFolder()` function to organize output by preset
- Updated `buildOutputPath()` to create preset-specific folders
- Files are now organized as: `outputDirectory/presetName/filename.ext`
- Cleaner file naming without preset suffixes in filenames

### 5. Content Security Policy Warning
**Problem**: Electron was showing security warnings about insecure CSP.

**Solution**:
- Added proper Content Security Policy to the main window
- Set secure web preferences with `webSecurity: true`
- Disabled `allowRunningInsecureContent`

### 6. Multiple File Compression Issues
**Problem**: Multiple files weren't being processed correctly with multiple presets.

**Solution**:
- Fixed task key generation to be consistent between frontend and backend
- Improved progress tracking for multiple concurrent compressions
- Better error handling for individual file failures
- Proper cleanup of compression tasks

### 7. Poor File Naming Convention
**Problem**: File names were basic and didn't indicate the preset used.

**Solution**:
- Created `createUserFriendlyFilename()` function for better naming
- Added preset suffixes to filenames (e.g., "video - Web.mp4")
- Cleaned up special characters and limited filename length
- Added index support for duplicate filenames
- User-friendly folder names (e.g., "Web Hero" instead of "web-hero")

### 8. No Default Output Directory
**Problem**: Users had to manually select an output directory every time.

**Solution**:
- Added `getDefaultOutputDirectory()` function for Mac
- Automatically creates "Compressed Videos" folder on Desktop
- App automatically sets default directory on startup
- Better UI indicators when using default directory
- Improved button text showing "Compress to Desktop"

### 9. No Batch File Renaming
**Problem**: Users couldn't rename multiple files at once for better organization.

**Solution**:
- Created `BatchRenameModal` component with multiple naming patterns
- Added support for custom prefixes, date-based naming, and clean names
- Real-time preview of file name changes
- Integrated with Electron backend for actual file renaming
- Automatic file path updates after renaming

### 10. No Default Directory Customization
**Problem**: Users couldn't change their default output directory preference.

**Solution**:
- Added "Set as default" functionality in settings
- Users can change default from Desktop to any folder
- Persistent default directory setting
- Easy reset to original default
- Clear UI indicators for current default

## Technical Improvements

### Progress Tracking Enhancements
- Added progress smoothing to prevent UI jitter
- Implemented meaningful change detection (≥0.5% difference)
- Better handling of FFmpeg's progress reporting quirks
- Separate progress handling for two-pass encoding (50% per pass)

### Error Handling
- Improved error reporting for individual file failures
- Better cleanup of failed compression tasks
- More descriptive error messages

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced unnecessary progress updates
- Better memory management for active compression tracking
- Improved task cleanup

### User Experience Improvements
- Automatic default output directory setup
- Better file naming with preset indicators
- Organized folder structure by preset
- Improved UI feedback for default settings
- Mac-optimized file paths and organization
- Batch file renaming with multiple patterns
- Default directory customization
- Real-time file rename preview

## File Structure Changes

### Output Organization
```
Desktop/Compressed Videos/
├── Web Hero/
│   ├── video1 - Hero.mp4
│   └── video2 - Hero.mp4
├── Web Standard/
│   ├── video1 - Web.mp4
│   └── video2 - Web.mp4
├── Instagram/
│   ├── video1 - IG.mp4
│   └── video2 - IG.mp4
└── TikTok/
    ├── video1 - TikTok.mp4
    └── video2 - TikTok.mp4
```

### File Naming Examples
- **Original**: `my_video.mp4`
- **Web Hero**: `my_video - Hero.mp4`
- **Instagram**: `my_video - IG.mp4`
- **WebM Modern**: `my_video - WebM.webm`
- **Duplicate handling**: `my_video - Web (1).mp4`

### Batch Rename Patterns
- **Custom Prefix**: "Video 1", "Video 2", "Video 3"
- **Date Based**: "2024-01-15 1", "2024-01-15 2"
- **Keep Original**: Preserves original filenames
- **Clean Names**: Removes special characters and spaces
